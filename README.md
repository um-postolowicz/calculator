# The Calculator
Visit the site here: https://calculator-ump.herokuapp.com
A simple calculator with standard operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. There are also a little more advanced operations like roots (square and others), powers (square and others), percents and reversing numbers.

## How does it work?
### Standard operations
The app works like usual calculator - you type a number by clicking on buttons with digits, then you choose an operation (addition, subtraction, etc.). After that you type another number and by clicking an equal sign you get a result on the calculator screen. After displaying a result you can use that result number for another operation - just click an operation sign, type a number and hit an equal button again.
### More advanced operations
Some of the operations (root, power) work just like standard ones. In case of operations like square root, square power, change the sign and reverse number you get a result right after clicking an operation number - for example, when you type 6 and hit square power button, you get a 36 immediately after the last click - you do not have to click an equal sign.
### Percent
How to use a percent function:
1. Choose the first number - it will be a base number, which you want to get the percent from -> let the number 6 be an example.
2. Hit the percent button.
3. Choose the second number - it will be a number of percents we want to get from the first number -> number 10 will be an example.
4. Hit the equal button - you will get 10% from number 6, which is 0.6.
### Unusual results
There are some operations which give an unusual results - no result at all or more than one result. 
#### No result
You will get that result after trying to divide a number by zero ("No division by 0!" on the calculator's screen), or after trying to get a square root (or any other even root) from a negative number ("No solution!" on the calculator's screen).
#### Two solutions
There are two solutions when you get an even root from a positive number - the result can be either negative or positive. After that kind of operation you will get two results on the screen - for example "6 or -6". That kind of result will appear ONLY after using the root operation button (not the square root one) - after using the square root one you will get only a positive number.
If you would like to continue counting after getting two results, a positive number will be used.
